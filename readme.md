# Car Maintenance ML Model with Backend API
I was inspired to do this side project after reading Balwant Gorad medium article, where his focus was to build complete end-to-end ML model, Backend RestAPI using FastAPI and front-end UI using Streamlit. His data set included a Car Price Prediction. 

My goal was to do it differently.
